switch
======

A lightweight switch-like widget using twitter bootstrap and jQuery. This is good for simulating states like on/off, user/admin etc.

The files to be included are switch.css and switch.js . For the buttons, this widget uses a btn-group. The html looks like this:
<!--switch like component-->

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rash-mi/6857269.js"></script>


If using the Foundation library, use the synonyous buttongroup class.
